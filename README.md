Fancier
========

With the release of iOS7, themeing switched from images to color-pallettes, and the need for a new themeing platform become visible to the jailbreak community. While others have attempted, Fancier was born to provide an on-demand, easy-to-use, live-theming platform with sharing capabilities built into it's core.

Status
---

* An alpha was scheduled to launch in mid-Feburary. Unfortunately, 64-bit support isn't fully built-out at this time with the settings bundle. Due to this, 5S devices have trouble seeing what element is currently being themed.
* Sharing is not currently implemented.
* More elements and higher per-app customizations are coming.
* Transparency controls are not yet implemented.
